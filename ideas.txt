- graphical improvements
- adding game size/difficulty to UI rather than passing as command line arguments
- adding a timer
- adding leaderboards with rankings based on time and difficulty
  - would likely need specific difficulty levels with set size & bomb numbers
- modifying game victory to trigger when all bombs are flagged correctly
  - currently it is set to trigger when all non-bombs are revealed




- Bugs
    - Once all flags are set, cannot unset flags.
    - (FIXED) If flag set on a non-bomb square, will be cleared (and flag will be lost) during the recursive reveal.
